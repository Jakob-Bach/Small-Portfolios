\section{Experimental Design}
\label{sec:experimental-design}

\paragraph{Implementation}

We implement our experimental design in Python and make our code available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Jakob-Bach/Small-Portfolios}}.
To create the dataset of solver runtimes, we use the package~\emph{gbd-tools}~\cite{iser2020collaborative}.
As prediction models, we use decision trees from the package \emph{scikit-learn}~\cite{scikit-learn}.
To solve the small portfolio-problem exactly, we use the package \emph{mip}~\cite{python-mip}.
